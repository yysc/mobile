			<p>
				Support for the One UI Launch standard is provided by the
				<span class="codeSnippet">idx/mobile/Launch</span> widget.
				Use of this widget is straightforward, and requires just
				three main steps.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Ensure &lt;body&gt; is initially hidden</h3>
			
			<p>
				To ensure that your page content is not seen by the app user before
				Dojo has been initialised, the parser has run, etc, make your page
				&lt;body&rt; tag initially invisible. The &lt;body&rt; tag will be
				automatically shown by the <span class="codeSnippet">idx/mobile/Launch</span>
				widget during initialisation.
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;body style="visibility: hidden;"&gt;</pre>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Require the idx/mobile/Launch widget</h3>
			
			<p>
				The widget will display the launch pane as soon as it executes. To
				present this at the earliest opportunity, list it first in the
				<span class="codeSnippet">require()</span> list.
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;script&gt;
	
	require(["idx/mobile/Launch",
			 ...
			 ...],
	function(Launch, ...){
		...
	});

&lt;script&gt;</pre>

			<p>
				The require of <span class="codeSnippet">idx/mobile/Launch</span>
				returns a single instance of the widget which is already displayed,
				and this can be used to hide the launch widget when finished with.
			</p>

			<h3>Hide the launch pane when the app is ready to display</h3>
			
			<p>
				At a suitable point when your app has loaded, the UI has been
				built, and the display is ready for the user, the Launch widget
				should be hidden. 
				
				<pre class="code">Launch.hide();</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Launch widget will destroy itself and all its
				resources during the call to <span class="codeSnippet">hide()</span>.
				If the Launch widget will be required again, true can be passed as the
				optional <span class="codeSnippet">keepAvailable</span> parameter:
				after calling <span class="codeSnippet">hide(true)</span> the widget
				remains available and can be reshown by calling <span class="codeSnippet">show()</span>.
				In normal usage, however, the launch pane is only required once.
			</p>
