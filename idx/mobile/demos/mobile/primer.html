			<p>
				This guide sets out some of the technical
				steps required to take
				advantage of the IDX toolkit and the One UI mobile theme
				in a web page or mobile hybrid app.
			</p>
				
			<h2>Controlling how your app is rendered</h2>
			
			<p>
				Your HTML will be rendered by the web browser or HTML rendering
				engine on the mobile device on which it is run. There are several
				important declarations you need to include in your page in order
				for the web browser or HTML rendering engine to make the right
				choices.
			</p>
			
			<h3>DOCTYPE declaration</h3>
			
			<p>
				The IDX One UI toolkit is intended to be used with HTML&nbsp;5 and
				each page should therefore begin with an HTML&nbsp;5 DOCTYPE
				declaration:
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre>
			</p>
			
			<h3>The "viewport" &lt;meta&gt; tag</h3>
			
			<p>
				The "viewport" &lt;meta&gt; tag is recognised by mobile browsers
				on several platforms including mobile Safari on iOS and Google
				Chrome on Android. Further
				<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html">details
				about the "viewport" &lt;meta&gt; tag</a> can be found on the
				Apple developer site. The following aspects are important for
				complying with the One UI standard:
				<ul>
					<li>Setting the initial "scale" to "1.0" ensures that the
					CSS-to-device-pixel ratio is set in line with the CSS
					reference pixel definition. The default scale if this
					setting is omitted can vary widely from one browser to
					another. This setting also means that the page does not
					rescale on orientation change, but rather remains at the
					same scale and changes the available dimensions, and this
					is important for building appropriately responsive app UIs.</li>
					
					<li>Enabling user scaling (typically supported on the mobile
					devices by a pinch-to-zoom gesture and touch-initiated panning
					while zoomed) is important to comply with the One UI
					accessibility guidance.</li>  
				</ul>	
			</p>
			
			<p>			
				The following "viewport" &lt;meta&gt; tag should be placed in the
				&lt;head&gt; section of each page to apply the above settings:
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes" /&gt;</pre>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Other &lt;meta&gt; tag</h3>
			
			<p>
				There are also some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html">&lt;meta&gt;
				tags recognised by mobile Safari</a> on iOS, that enable a web page loaded into the browser to
				declare that it can run 'full-screen' and to control the appearance
				of the status bar (the narrow bar containing various status icons
				such as battery charge and network connectivity that runs along
				the top of the screen in iOS). The following tags declare that a
				page is a web app (can be loaded standalone, with no browser chrome),
				and request a black status bar:
					 
		 		<pre class="code">&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black" /&gt;</pre>

			</p>
			
			<h2>Loading the One UI mobile theme</h2>
			
			<p>
				The One UI mobile theme comes in two varieties, one designed for iOS (iPhone/iPad)
				and the other for Android devices. These varieties enable certain parts of the theme
				to adapt to device-specific rendering conventions and interaction models, so it is
				important to ensure that the correct variety is loaded in the appropriate circumstances.
				The One UI standard also specifies that on other devices (<i>i.e.</i> that are neither
				iOS nor Android) the iOS variety should be used.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Loading the One UI mobile theme using idx/mobile/deviceTheme</h3>
			
			<p>
				To support responsive app design a module <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b> is provided
				that detects the platform on which the page is being loaded and loads the appropriate theme
				variety automatically. This is the recommended way to load the One UI mobile theme.
				The <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module is designed to be exactly compatible with
				the <b>dojox/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module provided by Dojo, but it loads the appropriate
				variety of the One UI mobile theme in place of the default dojox/mobile themes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is possible to <span class="codeSnippet">require()</span> the <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b>
				module, but it is important to load the theme files as early as possible in order to ensure
				that the theme definitions are in place when the dojox.mobile widgets initialise and so the
				<b>recommended way</b> to use the <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module is to load it directly
				<b>before</b> loading dojo.js. This can be done with a simple &lt;script&rt; tag as
				follows:
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;script src="...path-to-idx.../ibmjs/idx/mobile/deviceTheme.js"&rt;&lt;/script&rt;</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				No further steps are required when using this module: the necessary CSS files will be loaded
				automatically and the appropriate classes set onto the &lt;body&rt; tag. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is possible to configure the loading of theme files with various config variables that
				can be set up before loading the <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module or passed to the
				module on the &lt;script&rt; tag. The <b>idx/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module supports all
				the configuration variables that the <b>dojox/mobile/deviceTheme</b> module supports,
				and in exactly the same way.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Loading the One UI mobile theme directly</h3> 
			
			<p>
				A page or app can load each theme variety directly if required by loading the
				following CSS files:
				<ul>
					<li>for the iOS variety: <span class="codeSnippet">/idx/mobile/themes/oneui_ios/oneui_ios.css</span>.
					The CSS class "<span class="codeSnippet">oneui_ios_theme</span>" should also be added to the &lt;body&rt; tag.
					<li>for the Android variety: <span class="codeSnippet">/idx/mobile/themes/oneui_android/oneui_android.css</span>.
					The CSS class "<span class="codeSnippet">oneui_android_theme</span>" should also be added to the &lt;body&rt; tag.
				</ul>
				This may be appropriate for an app designed for deployment on one specific platform only.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Loading Dojo</h2>
			
			<p>
				The "dojo.js" entry point to Dojo should be loaded via a &lt;script&rt; tag in the usual
				way. In order to use dojox/mobile features you should include "dojox/mobile" in your 
				list of <span class="codeSnippet">require()</span>s.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Registering IDX as a Dojo package</h3>
			
			<p>
				In order to be able to use the additional widgets provided by IDX to support the One UI
				standards, "idx" needs to be registered as a package to Dojo. This can be done by setting
				the 'packages' structure in the dojo config in the following way:
				
				<pre class="code">packages: [
	{name: "dojo", location: "./" },          // standard definition
	{name: "dijit", location: "../dijit" },   // standard definition
	{name: "dojox", location: "../dojox" },   // standard definition
	{name: "gridx", location: "../gridx" },
	{name: "idx", location: "...path-from-dojo-to-idx.../ibmjs/idx" },
	... any other package definitions required ...
]</pre>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Parsers</h3>
			
			<p>
				If your page will include declarative (HTML) definitions of widgets, either
				from the dojox/mobile package or from idx/mobile (additional widgets provided by
				IDX to support the One UI standards) or a mixture of both, you will need to load
				a parser and ask it to parse the page content. There is a choice of two parsers
				available in Dojo:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="codeSnippet">dojox/mobile/Parser</span>, a lightweight parser
					with a small download footprint but also reduced functionality, suitable if your
					page only contains simply widget declarations.</li>
					<li><span class="codeSnippet">dijit/Parser</span>, the full-function parser
					that includes support for &lt;script&rt; tag declarations of methods and handlers
					and similar advanced features.</li> 
				</ul>
				Whichever parser you choose, you will need to <span class="codeSnippet">require()</span>
				the appropriate module and then either call the <span class="codeSnippet">parse()</span>
				method on it or enable parseOnLoad in the dojo config.
			</p>

			<h3>Page initialisation</h3>
			
			<p>
				It is not generally desirable for your page content to be seen by the app user before
				Dojo has been initialised, the parser has run, etc, as the layout and styling will
				look very odd and a disturbing reformatting flash will occur as the widgets become
				initialised. To avoid this, make your page &lt;body&rt; tag initially invisible.
				The &lt;body&rt; tag will be automatically shown by dojox/mobile during initialisation.
				
				<pre class="code">&lt;body style="visibility: hidden;"&rt;</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The <b>idx/mobile/Launch</b> widget provides support for the One UI Launch standard,
				and this widget too will automatically show the &lt;body&rt; tag as soon as the
				launch pane is in ready to be displayed to the user.
			</p>

			<h2>Responsive app design</h2>
			
			<p>
				Although many aspects of One UI apply to all mobile platforms, there are certain 
				platform-specific differences that mean that there are likely to be circumstances
				in which an app needs to provide different styling, or a different JavaScript code
				path, according to whether the app is using the iOS variety or the Android variety
				of the One UI theme.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Even more importantly, there may well be circumstances
				in which an app needs to provide different styling, or a different JavaScript code
				path, according to whether the app is on a "phone"-type device (small format screen)
				or a "tablet"-type device (larger format screen), or according to whether the device
				is in "portrait" orientation (height greater than width) or "landscape" orientation
				(width greater than height).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These forms of adaptation by an app are termed "responsive design". <!-- The following
				sections identify how these features can be enabled.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Detecting theme variety, screen size and orientation in CSS</h3>
			
			<p>Using CSS classes to hide UI elements that are only visible in certain configurations (.androidOnly etc.)</p>
			
			<h3>Detecting theme variety, screen size and orientation in JavaScript code</h3>
			
			<p>detecting UI flavour vs actual platform - use (dojox.mobile.currentTheme === "oneui_android")</p-->
